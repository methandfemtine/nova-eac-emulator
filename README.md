## How does it work?

Linux EAC runs on Wine, but it has really vulnerable checks. By side-loading DLLs, it hooks the communication with EAC and proxies the contents to Windows.

## How to use

Basic Setup: [Use VMWare (Recommended for most people)](./SETUP_GUIDE.md)  
Advanced User Setup: [Use WSL](./SETUP_GUIDE_WSL.md)
